    </h1>
    
       
        <article>
            <h2>Introduction :</h2>
            <p>An average traveler starts researching before they even have a particular destination in mind. And it takes them about 15 weeks to make a final decision. Interestingly, in the era of flight aggregators and websites with massive hotel inventories, as consumers, we still tend to trust our own instincts and dig for better and cheaper options. This also means that online travel platforms have an opportunity to affect our final decision if their proposition is very attractive.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion :</h2>
            <p>e-Tourism take advantage of having a better opportunity to understand the customer. That data collection is getting bigger and smarter. It’s used to target customers with optimized search results, specific sort order and filters, and even the number of results because some buyers can be overwhelmed if they see more than five. OTAs could go even further and pass their discoveries on to their partners in terms of what could be done to increase the value of their services, particularly how to make their offers more available to different customer tiers. </p>

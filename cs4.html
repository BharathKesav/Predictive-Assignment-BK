            <h2>Data Description :</h2>
            <p>The nomenclature of parts subject to non-destructive testing is quite extensive. The main objects of control are:
            <ul>
                <li>Details of the propulsion and steering complex: — propeller shafts, propeller screws, stocks.</li>
                <li>Parts of the internal combustion engine: crankshafts, side shafts, connecting rods, connecting rod bolts, piston pins, piston bushings, pistons, block- crankcase. The defects to be controlled are divided into two types:</li> 
                Manufacturing defects: Foundry: shrinkage and gas cavities, interstices; cracks; liquations; lack of fusion; slag inclusions.
             </ul>   
                Pressure treatment: forging folds; backfins; cracks; stratification. Welding defects [1–3]: incomplete penetrations, undercuts, cracks, inclusions, scabs, interstices, honeycombs.
                
                Heat treatment [4,5]: cracks, hardness mismatch, coarse-grained metal structure, knuckling.</p>

            <h2>Techniques Used : </h2>
            <p>The methods of non-destructive testing of machines’ parts and mechanisms of ship equipment operating in various service conditions were investigated in this work. During cavitation, waterjet wear and sliding friction. A qualitative assessment of the applicability of various methods of non-destructive testing was performed:
                <ul>
                <li>visual and measurement control</li>
                
                <li>ultrasonic monitoring</li>
                
                <li>radiographic control</li>
                
                <li>capillary control</li>
                
                <li>magnetic control</li>
                
                <li>eddy current control</li>
                
                <li>the method of magnetic memory of metal</li>
                </ul>
                
                Non-destructive testing of the piston pin of the NVD36 engine by ultrasonic testing, control of penetrating substances and the method of magnetic memory of metal shows that the part is flaw-detective, it has a simple shape, small roughness, structural homogeneity of the metal. Ultrasonic monitoring was performed by the echo method with the UD2B-P device using a straight and inclined sensor with an input angle of 65. Clear echo signals from a transverse crack at a depth of 83 mm, reducing the back wall signal. When scanning the forming surface with an inclined sensor, an echo signal from a longitudinal crack at a depth of 15 mm is detected along the chord.The magnetic memory control was performed by the device ICNM-2FP, scanning was performed along a circle in five sections. The detected stress concentration zones of the part coincide with the cracks detected by ultrasonic testing, a longitudinal crack in the region of four hours and stress jumps from the transverse crack in the range from zero to four hours.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion :</h2>
            <p> Flaw detection depends on the following factors:
                <ul>
                <li>Control conditions (workshop, ship, laboratory).</li>
                <li>Condition of control’s object (surface cleanliness, lubricant residues, paint, rust).</li>
                <li>Surface shape.</li>
                <li>Thickness of the controlled metal.</li>
                <li>The material of the part and its structural state (grain size).</li>
                <li>Surface roughness.</li>
                <li>As an alternative, we can recommend the use of the method of magnetic memory of metal, which does not have such requirements as roughness, complexity of the shape of the controlled part. It shows a high detectability of defects caused by fatigue damage to the metal. It is possible to recommend the use of combined control by the method of magnetic memory of metaleddy current control, by the method of magnetic memory of metal — control of penetrating substances, eddy current control–control of penetrating substances.</li></ul></p>
